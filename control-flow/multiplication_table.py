2. Multiplication Table Generator
mandatory
Objective: Use a for loop to generate and print the multiplication table for a given number.

Task Description:

Create a Python script named multiplication_table.py. This script will ask the user to enter a number, 
then use a for loop to print the multiplication table for that number from 1 to 10.

Instructions:

Prompt User for a Number:

Ask the user to input a number for which they want to see the multiplication table: Enter a number to see its multiplication table:.
Save it in a variable name number
Generate and Print the Multiplication Table:

Use a for loop to iterate through the numbers 1 to 10.
For each iteration, calculate the product of the user’s number and the iterator (the current number in the loop from 1 to 10).
Print each line of the multiplication table in the format: “X * Y = Z”, where X is the user’s number, Y is the current number in the loop, and Z is the product.
Example Interaction:

If the user inputs 5, the output should be:

Enter a number to see its multiplication table: 5
5 * 1 = 5
5 * 2 = 10
5 * 3 = 15
5 * 4 = 20
5 * 5 = 25
5 * 6 = 30
5 * 7 = 35
5 * 8 = 40
5 * 9 = 45
5 * 10 = 50
This task is designed to reinforce the concept of for loops by applying them in a practical scenario that generates a multiplication table. 
Through this exercise, students will learn how loops can significantly simplify the process of performing repetitive tasks, 
enhancing their understanding of looping constructs in Python.
