4. Personal Daily Reminder
mandatory
Objective: Create a simplified Python script that uses conditional statements, Match Case, and loops to remind the user about a single, priority task for the day based on time sensitivity.

Task Description:

Develop a script named daily_reminder.py. This script will ask the user for a single task, its priority level, and if it is time-sensitive. The program will then provide a customized reminder for that task, demonstrating control flow and loops without relying on data structures to store multiple tasks.

Instructions:

Prompt for a Single Task:

Ask the user to input a task description and save it into a task variable
Prompt for the task’s priority (high, medium, low) and save it into a priority variable
In a time_bound variable, Ask if the task is time-bound (yes or no)
Process the Task Based on Priority and Time Sensitivity:

Use a Match Case statement to react differently based on the task’s priority.
Within the Match Case or after, use an if statement to modify the reminder if the task is time-bound.
Provide a Customized Reminder:

Print a reminder about the task that includes its priority level and whether immediate action is required based on time sensitivity.
A message should be ‘that requires immediate attention today!’
Example Interaction and Output:

Enter your task: Finish project report
Priority (high/medium/low): high
Is it time-bound? (yes/no): yes

Reminder: 'Finish project report' is a high priority task that requires immediate attention today!
Or, for a non-time-bound task:

Enter your task: Read a book
Priority (high/medium/low): low
Is it time-bound? (yes/no): no

Note: 'Read a book' is a low priority task. Consider completing it when you have free time.

task = input("Enter your task: ")

priority = input("Priority (high/medium/low): ")

time_bound = input("Is it time-bound? (yes/no): ")

match priority:

    case "high":
        if time_bound == "yes":
            print(f"{task} requires immediate attention today.")
        else:
            print(f"{task} is high prioriy task. It requires immediate attendtion.")

    case "medium":
        if time_bound == "yes":
            print(f"{task} requires attendtion at the scheduled time.")
        else:
            print(f"{task} needs to be done.")

    case "low":
        if time_bound == "yes":
            print(f"{task} task is yet to be done.")
        else:
            print(f"{task} is a low priority task. Consider completing it when you have free time.")
