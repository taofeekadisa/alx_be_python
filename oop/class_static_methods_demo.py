3. Distinguishing Between Class Methods and Static Methods
mandatory
Objective: Solidify your understanding of class methods and static methods in Python by implementing examples of each in a class, 
demonstrating their usage and differences.

Task Description:
Create a Python script named class_static_methods_demo.py. In this script, define a class Calculator 
that includes both a class method and a static method to perform calculations. This task aims to illustrate when and 
how to use @classmethod and @staticmethod decorators, highlighting their differences and practical applications.

class_static_methods_demo.py:
Calculator Class:

Static Method - add(a, b): Returns the sum of two numbers. Use the @staticmethod decorator.
Class Method - multiply(cls, a, b): Returns the product of two numbers. Use the @classmethod decorator and 
ensure it prints a class attribute named calculation_type before performing the multiplication.
Class Attribute:

Define a class attribute calculation_type with a value of "Arithmetic Operations" that the multiply class method will reference.
Implementation Example:
class Calculator:
    calculation_type = "Arithmetic Operations"

    @staticmethod
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

    @classmethod
    def multiply(cls, a, b):
        print(f"Calculation type: {cls.calculation_type}")
        return a * b
main.py (Provided for Testing):
This script will test the Calculator classâ€™s static and class methods, demonstrating their functionality and how they are called.

from class_static_methods_demo import Calculator

def main():
    # Using the static method
    sum_result = Calculator.add(10, 5)
    print(f"The sum is: {sum_result}")

    # Using the class method
    product_result = Calculator.multiply(10, 5)
    print(f"The product is: {product_result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Expected Output:
When you run main.py, it should produce the following output, 
which includes the printed message from the class method and the results of the calculations:

The sum is: 15
Calculation type: Arithmetic Operations
The product is: 50
Note for you:
Understand the use of @staticmethod for functions that perform a task in isolation, 
without needing access to class or instance-specific data.
Grasp the concept of @classmethod for functions that need to access class attributes or 
methods and understand how the cls parameter allows access to class-level attributes.
This task underscores the distinction between class methods and static methods in Python, 
providing clarity on their appropriate use cases and advantages.
