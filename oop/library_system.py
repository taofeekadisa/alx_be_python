1. Mastering Inheritance and Composition in Python
mandatory
Objective: Deepen your understanding of inheritance and composition in Python by creating a system that models a library with different types of books.

Task Description:
Develop two Python scripts: library_system.py and main.py. 
In library_system.py, youâ€™ll define a base class Book and two derived classes, EBook and PrintBook, showcasing inheritance. 
Additionally, implement a Library class demonstrating composition by managing a collection of books.

library_system.py:
Base Class - Book:

Attributes: title (str) and author (str).
Method: __init__(self, title, author) for initializing book attributes.
Derived Classes - EBook and PrintBook:

Both classes inherit from Book.
EBook additional attribute: file_size (int).
PrintBook additional attribute: page_count (int).
Each derived class should have its own __init__ method that properly calls the base class __init__ while also initializing its unique attribute.
Composition - Library:

Attributes: books (a list to store instances of Book, EBook, and PrintBook).
Methods:
add_book(self, book): Adds a Book, EBook, or PrintBook instance to the library.
list_books(self): Prints details of each book in the library.
main.py (Provided for Testing):
This script tests the functionality of your classes in library_system.py by adding different types of books to a Library instance and listing them.

from library_system import Book, EBook, PrintBook, Library

def main():
    # Create a Library instance
    my_library = Library()

    # Create instances of each type of book
    classic_book = Book("Pride and Prejudice", "Jane Austen")
    digital_novel = EBook("Snow Crash", "Neal Stephenson", 500)
    paper_novel = PrintBook("The Catcher in the Rye", "J.D. Salinger", 234)

    # Add books to the library
    my_library.add_book(classic_book)
    my_library.add_book(digital_novel)
    my_library.add_book(paper_novel)

    # List all books in the library
    my_library.list_books()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Expected Output:
Your output should list the details of each book added to the library, 
reflecting the specific attributes of EBook and PrintBook, as well as the common attributes inherited from Book.

Book: Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen
EBook: Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson, File Size: 500KB
PrintBook: The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger, Page Count: 234
